## Development

You should have nodejs and npm installed on your machine.

### Download the packages

```
npm install
```

### Run app on your local environment

In project root, to start the client side of the application:

```
npm run start-dev
```
This will start both client and server side of application.

Optionally you can specify a port by supplying the `PORT` env variable.

Automatically a new browser window will be opened which points to `http://localhost:8080`.

After that, point a new browser tab to `http://localhost:8080` in order to simulate the other user behaviours.

Now you are free to send some messages to other users who are connected to the room already :)

### For optimized production build

```
npm run build
```

### Run the tests

```
npm run test
```
